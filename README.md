`Hello World!`


Hi, I'm Aidan! I love problem-solving, and computer science is full of interesting problems to work on. I'm currently doing a data engineering internship at RBC Amplify, and large language model research at the Computational Social Science Lab.

- ðŸ‘€ Topics I'm interested in: algorithm design (graph algorithms), machine learning algorithms, large language models, web development, data science/engineering
- ðŸŒ± What I've been working on: How can we use large language models to teach chess algorithmically?
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Where I am: Toronto, ON
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: shoot me an email at aidan.li@mail.utoronto.ca

Have a great day!
