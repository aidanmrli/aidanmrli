`Hello World!`


Hi, my name is Aidan! I love problem-solving, and computer science is full of interesting problems. On my GitHub, you can see some of the projects and problems I am working on.
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithm design (e.g. graph algorithms), machine learning, and data science/engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a Voiceflow chatbot transcript processing web app.
- 📫 How to reach me: shoot me an email at aidan.li@mail.utoronto.ca

Have a great day!
